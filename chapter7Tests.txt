Tested Files:
	test1.tig ****** arrayVar and arrayConst were taking their parameters swapped.
					arrayVar doesn't seem to be outputting what it should be
    test4.tig
    test8.tig
    test12.tig ****** there is an error in trexp (A.SeqExp expList) that causes loss of the a:=a+1 statement

UntestedFiles:
    test1 - test3

Can't test Files:
    test5.tig (we don't handle recursive types)
    test6.tig (we don't handle recursive functions)
    test7.tig (^^^)
    9 -11 (Error test)


Chapter 7, things that I understand and so I know they work:

1. if statements

Things I don't understand and so don't know if they work:

1. function call, static links (I think I believe it now)
