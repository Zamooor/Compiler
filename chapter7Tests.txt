Tested Files:
	test1.tig ****** There might still be an error with allocLocal, not sure it's ever
						giving an offset other than 0
	test2.tig ***** Essentially the same as test1
    test4.tig
    test8.tig
    test12.tig ****** there is an error in trexp (A.SeqExp expList) that causes loss of the a:=a+1 statement

UntestedFiles:
    test3

Can't test Files:
    test5.tig (we don't handle recursive types)
    test6.tig (we don't handle recursive functions)
    test7.tig (^^^)
    9 -11 (Error test)


Chapter 7, things that I understand and so I know they work:
